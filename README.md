# restaurant-menu-html-project
This is a beginner-friendly HTML project that recreates a restaurant menu for Black Goose Bistro.


This project is a static restaurant menu webpage created using HTML. It displays the Black Goose Bistro Summer Menu, including appetizers, main courses, pricing, and business details. The project focuses on practicing semantic HTML structure and clear content organization for a real-world website layout.This project demonstrates my ability to structure web content using semantic elements and present information in a clean, user-friendly layout suitable for a small business website.
