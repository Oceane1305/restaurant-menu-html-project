<h2> Low and Slow</h2> 
        <p>posted by BGB, <time datetime="2016-11-15"> November 15, 2016 </time></p>

    This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food

(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food.

In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.
    
    
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</strong>
